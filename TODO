HIGH PRIORITY
[ ] Set MAX_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT to max seen ping
[ ] unverified (timeout)
[ ] TODO12
[ ] TODO22
[ ] Add CPeer*p1,p2 in CPoC
[ ] Update nodes after sending Alert
[ ] Only save outbound peers ? - return only outbound in topology?
[ ] Put CNetNode in CPeer
[ ] Delete CNetNode if node disconnects
[ ] Move cross-check to beginning of recv(PEERS):
    - findPeer(peer.IP) #This only works when IPs are different
    - 2 public nodes can run on the same IP. we cannot assume we know the node by knowing the base IP
[ ] Delete disconnected nodes? - maybe we just losed connection. check if it's anyone's peer
[X] When poc expires, stop checking it!!
    - [ ] Delete it?
[ ] ? Eliminate inbound peers from peerlist ?
[ ] If we receive an inbound peer, check if we tried poc and failed. if so report to node

LOW PRIORITY
[ ] Replace nNow with current_time
[ ] BCLog::POC #Keep basic log as NET, and 2nd-level log as POC
[ ] Create a POC list to quickly find a POC when receiving it back
[ ] Optimization: keep sending poc on verified connections; peers only send new peers
[ ] TODO01

---------------------------
[X] Put CNetNode * in CNode
[X] Put CPoC in CNetNode
[X] When starting new round, don't set peer as unverified if they already are
 |
 -- [X] Check when !fVerified is used
[X] fVerified = false when POC fails
