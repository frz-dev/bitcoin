HIGH PRIORITY
[ ] Delete disconnected nodes? - maybe we just losed connection. check if it's anyone's peer
[X] When poc expires, stop checking it!!
    - [ ] Delete it?
[ ] Eliminate inbound peers from peerlist ?
[ ] If we receive an inbound peer, check if we tried poc and failed. if so report to node

LOW PRIORITY
[ ] Replace nNow with current_time
[ ] BCLog::POC #Keep basic log as NET, and 2nd-level log as POC
[ ] Create a POC list to quickly find a POC when receiving it back

---------------------------
[X] Put CNetNode * in CNode
[X] Put CPoC in CNetNode
[X] When starting new round, don't set peer as unverified if they already are
 |
 -- [X] Check when !fVerified is used
[X] fVerified = false when POC fails
